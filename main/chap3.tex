\chapter{Chipsplitting Games}

The notion of a chipsplitting game was introduced in \cite{bik2022classifying} as a combinatorial approach to count fundamental models. It was inspired by \emph{chip-firing games} \cite{klivans2018mathematics}. 

\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}
    Let $(V,E)$ be a directed graph without loops.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A \emph{chip configuration} is a vector \( \mathbf{w} = (w_v)_{v \in V} \in \mathbb{Z}^{V} \) such that there are only finitely many nonzero components \( w_k \).
        \item The \emph{initial configuration} is the chip configuration \( \mathbf 0  \in \mathbb{Z}^V \).
        \item A \emph{splitting move} at \( u \in V \), denoted by \( \mathrm{split}_u \), maps chip configurations \( \mathbf w \) to chip configurations \( \mathbf{w}' \) defined by \( w'_v \coloneqq \begin{cases}
            w_v -1 & \text{if } v = u, \\
            w_v + 1 & \text{if } (u,v) \in E ,\\
            w_v & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases} \)
        \item An \emph{unsplitting move} at \( u \in V \), denoted by \( \mathrm{unsplit}_u \), maps \( \mathbf w' \) back to \( \mathbf{w} \). 
        \item A \emph{chipsplitting game} is a finite sequence of splitting and unsplitting moves.
        \item An \emph{outcome of a chipsplitting game} is the chip configuration obtained from applying the splitting and unsplitting moves defined by the game at the initial configuration.
        % \item Any outcome of a chipsplitting game is called an \emph{outcome}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:commutativity}
    The order of moves in a chipsplitting game does not affect the outcome.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    This follows from commutativity of addition.
\end{proof}

Since all moves are reversible, we obtain the following corollary with Proposition \ref{prop:commutativity}.

\begin{corollary}
    Let \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{Z}^{V} \) be an outcome. Then, there exists a chipsplitting game such that its outcome equals \( \mathbf{w} \) and where at no point both a splitting and an unsplitting move are applied at the same vertex in the game.
\end{corollary}

Games that satisfy the condition in the corollary are called \emph{reduced}. The map 
\begin{align}
    \left\{ \text{reduced games on \( (V,E) \)} \right\} / \sim \quad &\to \quad  \left\{ g: V' \to \mathbb{Z} : \# \{ p \in V' : g(p) \neq 0 \} < \infty \right\} \\
    f &\mapsto (p \mapsto \text{number of moves at \( p \) in game \( f \)})
\end{align}
is a bijection, where \( V' \subset V \) is the subset of vertices with at least one outgoing edge, and the map \( (p \mapsto \text{number of moves at \( p \) in game \( f \)} )\) counts unsplitting moves negatively. The equivalence relation \( \sim \) is defined by \( f \sim g \) if and only if \( f \) and \( g \) are the same up to reordering. We identify a chipsplitting game with its corresponding function \( V' \to \mathbb{Z} \). For every outcome \( \mathbf{w} = (w_v)_{v \in V} \) we have \(     w_v = -f(v) + \sum_{u\in V', (u,v) \in E} f(u)\), where we set \( f(t) = 0 \) for \( t \notin V \).

Now, we define the directed graphs we consider in this thesis.

\begin{definition}
    For \( d \in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ \infty \right\} \), we define the vertices \( V_d \coloneqq \left\{ (i,j) \in \mathbb{Z}^2_{\geq 0} \mid i+j \leq d \right\} \) and the edges \( E_d \coloneqq \left\{ (v,v+e) \mid v \in V_{d-1}, e \in \left\{ (1,0), (0,1) \right\} \right\} \).
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
    The degree \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf{v}) \) of a vertex \( \mathbf{v} = (i,j) \) is defined as \( i + j \).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    A chip configuration \( \mathbf{w} = (w_{i,j})_{(i,j) \in V_d} \in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) can be illustrated as a triangle of numbers where \( w_{i,j} \) is placed at the position \( (i,j) \). For example, \( w_{2,4} = 4 \) means that the value \( 4 \) is placed in the third column and fifth row of the triangle (note that we start counting from index \( 0 \)). The following is an example of a sequence of chip configurations for \( d = 3 \):
    \begin{verbatim}
.           .           .           1           1           1
. .         . .         1 .         . 1         . 1         . .
. . .       1 . .       . 2 .       . 2 .       . 2 1       . 3 .
0 . . .    -1 1 . .    -1 . 1 .    -1 . 1 .    -1 . . 1    -1 . . 1
    \end{verbatim}
    When we have \( w_{i,j} = 0 \), we omit the value and write \texttt{.} instead. The sequence above starts with the initial configuration and then applies splitting moves at the vertices \( (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (0,2) \) and \( (2,0) \). Finally, we apply an unsplitting move at vertex \( (1,1) \).
\end{example}

\begin{definition}\label{def:chip-terminology}
    Let \( \mathbf{w} = (w_{i,j})_{(i,j) \in V_d} \) be a chip configuration.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \emph{positive support} of \( \mathbf{w} \) is defined as \( \mathrm{supp}^+(\mathbf{w}) \coloneqq \left\{ (i,j) \in V_d\mid w_{i,j} > 0 \right\} \).
        \item The \emph{negative support} of \( \mathbf{w} \) is defined as \( \mathrm{supp}^-(\mathbf{w}) \coloneqq \left\{ (i,j) \in V_d\mid w_{i,j} < 0 \right\} \).
        \item The \emph{support} of \( \mathbf{w} \) is defined as the union of the positive and negative support.
        \item The \emph{degree} of \( \mathbf{w} \) is defined as \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf{w}) \coloneqq \mathrm{max}\left\{ i+j \mid (i,j) \in \mathrm{supp}(\mathbf{w}) \right\} \).
        \item We say \( \mathbf{w} \) is \emph{valid} if its negative support is empty or only contains \( (0,0) \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We are interested in chip configurations that are \emph{outcomes} and \emph{valid} since they correspond to reduced models as we will see later. For that reason, it would be convenient to have a criterion for when a chip configuration is an outcome. The next section will provide an algebraic criterion using \emph{Pascal equations}.

\begin{example}\label{ex:dknfkdjsfnsdj}
    Consider the following chip configuration:
    \begin{verbatim}
        · 
        ·   1 
        1   ·   5 
        ·   5   ·   2 
        1   .   .   5   . 
        ·   .   8   .   .   2 
       -2   ·   .   .   .   2   . 
    \end{verbatim}
    We clearly see that this configuration is valid, but is it also an outcome of a chipsplitting game? Currently, the only way to answer this question is to apply all possible sequences of splitting and unsplitting moves at the initial configuration, and check if the outcome equals the configuration above.
\end{example}


%TO-DO: define weakly valid if we havent done so

\section{Pascal Forms}

In this section, we establish that outcomes are roots of Pascal forms. To begin, we first define \emph{linear forms}, as Pascal forms are a specific type of linear form.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{linear form} on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) is a map \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \to \mathbb{Z}, \mathbf{w} \mapsto \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j} w_{i,j} \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{Pascal form} on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) is a linear form \( \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j} x_{i,j} \) on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) satisfying \( c_{i,j} = c_{i+1,j} + c_{i,j+1}\) for all $(i,j) \in V_{d-1}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    We can visualize a Pascal form as a triangle where \( c_{i,j} \) is placed at the position \( (i,j) \). Here are examples of Pascal forms for \( d = 2 \):
    \begin{verbatim}
  0               1               0               0
  1  1            1  0            0  0            1  1
  2  1  0         1  0  0         1  1  1         0 -1 -2
    \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

Evaluating Pascal equations is invariant under splitting and unsplitting moves. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:pascal-invariance}
    Let \( \mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be a chip configuration. Let \( p = \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) be a Pascal equation on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \). Then,  we have \( p(\mathbf w) = p(\mathrm{split}_u(\mathbf w)) = p(\mathrm{unsplit}_{v}(\mathbf w)) \) for all \( u, v \in V_{d-1} \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( u \coloneqq (i',j') \in V_{d-1} \).
    By the Pascal property, we have \( c_{i'+1,j'} + c_{i',j'+1} - c_{i',j'}= 0 \).
    Thus, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        p(\mathrm{split}_u(\mathbf w)) = \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j} (\mathrm{split}_u(\mathbf w))_{i,j} &= \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j} \begin{cases}
            w_{i,j} - 1 & \text{if } (i,j) = u, \\
            w_{i,j} + 1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in \left\{ (i'+1,j'), (i',j'+1) \right\} \\
            w_{i,j} & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}\\&= \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j} w_{i,j} = p(\mathbf w).
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, we can show that \( p(\mathrm{unsplit}_v(\mathbf w)) = p(\mathbf w) \) for all \( v \in V_{d-1} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let \( \mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be an outcome. Let \( p = \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) be a Pascal equation on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \). Then, \( p(\mathbf w) = 0 \).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Clearly, we have \( p(\mathbf 0) = 0 \). Then, we use Proposition \ref{prop:pascal-invariance} and the fact that \( \mathbf{w} \) is obtained from the initial configuration \( \mathbf{0} \) by a sequence of splitting and unsplitting moves.
\end{proof}

This proves that outcomes are roots of Pascal equations. The converse is also true.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pascal-outcome}
    Let \( \mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be a chip configuration. Then, \( \mathbf{w} \) is an outcome if and only if \( \mathbf{w} \) is a root of all Pascal equations on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \).
\end{theorem}

First, let us introduce a basis from which we generate all Pascal forms through linear combinations. This helps us to prove the direction from right to left in Theorem \ref{thm:pascal-outcome}.

\begin{example}\label{ex:pascal-basis}
    Let \( d = 2 \). We claim that the following set of Pascal forms is a basis:
    \begin{verbatim}
        0               0               1               
        0  0            1  1            0 -1           
        1  1  1,        0 -1 -2,        0  0  1.     
    \end{verbatim}
    Note that the zeroth column of each Pascal form is a unit vector in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). Let us fix the zeroth row of each Pascal form to be a unit vector in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \):
    \begin{verbatim}
        1              -2               1               
        1  0           -1  1            0 -1           
        1  0  0,        0  1  0,        0  0  1.
    \end{verbatim} 
    We denote the first set by \( \left\{ \mathrm{col}(0), \mathrm{col}(1), \mathrm{col}(2) \right\} \) and the second one by \( \{ \mathrm{row}(0), \mathrm{row}(1), \mathrm{row}(2) \} \).
\end{example}

We generalize this example.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:supsup-pascal}
    Let \( \mathbf{a} = (a_0, \dots, a_d) \) be any vector with integer entries. Then, the following two statements hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exists a unique Pascal form \( \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) such that \( c_{0,\cdot} = \mathbf a \).
        \item There exists a unique Pascal form \( \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) such that \( c_{\cdot,0} = \mathbf a \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Set \( c_{0,\cdot} \coloneqq \mathbf a \). Define \( c_{i+1,j} \coloneqq c_{i,j} - c_{i,j+1}\) for all \( (i,j) \in V_d \) with \( i=0 \). Then, we use the same formula to define \( c_{i+1,j} \) for all \( (i,j) \in V_d \) with \( i=1 \). We repeat this process until we have defined all \( c_{i,j} \) for \( (i,j) \in V_d \).

    For the second statement, we set \( c_{\cdot,0} \coloneqq \mathbf a \). Define \( c_{i,j+1} \coloneqq c_{i,j} - c_{i+1,j}\) for all \( (i,j) \in V_d \) with \( j=0 \). Then, we use the same formula to define \( c_{i,j+1} \) for all \( (i,j) \in V_d \) with \( j=1 \). We repeat this process until we have defined all \( c_{i,j} \) for \( (i,j) \in V_d \).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:row-col}
    Let \( k = 0, \dots, d \) and \( \mathbf e_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \) be the \( k \)-th unit vector. We define \( \mathrm{col}(k) \) to be the unique Pascal form \( \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) such that \( c_{0,\cdot} = \mathbf e_k \). We define \( \mathrm{row}(k) \) to be the unique Pascal form \( \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j} \) such that \( c_{\cdot,0} = \mathbf e_k \).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Consider the Pascal forms \( \mathrm{col}(3) \) and \( \mathrm{row}(3) \) for \( d = 7 \). We visualize it as follows: 
    \begin{verbatim}
·                               -35
·   ·                           -20  15
·   ·   ·                       -10  10  -4
·   ·   ·   ·                    -4   6  -4   1 
1   1   1   1   1                -1   3  -3   1   . 
·  -1  -2  -3  -4  -5             ·   1  -2   1   .   . 
·   ·   1   3   6  10  15         ·   ·  -1   1   .   .   . 
·   ·   ·  -1  -4 -10 -20 -35.    ·   ·   ·   1   .   .   .   .
    \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

We set \( \binom{a}{b} = 0 \) for \( b < 0 \) or \( b > a \).

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:pascal-formulas}
    For all integers \( k = 0, \dots, d \), the following formulas hold:
    \begin{gather*}
        \mathrm{col}(k)  = (-1)^k \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} (-1)^j \binom{i}{k-j} x_{i,j} \quad \text{and} \quad
        \mathrm{row}(k) = (-1)^k \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} (-1)^i \binom{j}{k-i} x_{i,j}.
    \end{gather*} 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We claim that \( (-1)^k \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} (-1)^j \binom{i}{k-j} x_{i,j} \) is a Pascal equation. For all \( (i,j) \in V_{d} \) we observe \( (-1)^j \binom{i+1}{k-j} + (-1)^{j+1} \binom{i}{k-j-1} = (-1)^j \binom{i}{k-j} \)
     since we use \(  \binom{a}{b+1} + \binom{a}{b} = \binom{a+1}{b+1} \) with \( a \coloneqq i \) and \( b \coloneqq k-j-1 \). Next, we see that \( (-1)^{k+j} \binom{0}{k-j} = \delta_{jk} \). Thus, \( (-1)^k \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} (-1)^j \binom{i}{k-j} x_{i,j} = \mathrm{col}(k) \) holds.

     By symmetry, we can use the same argument to show the second formula.
\end{proof}

Next, we show that \( \left\{ \mathrm{col}(k) \right\}_{k=0}^{d} \) is a basis for Pascal forms on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \).

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:pascal-basis}
    Let \( d \in \mathbb{N} \) and \( p \) be a Pascal form on \( \mathbb Z^{V_d} \). The following statements hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exist unique coefficients \( \mu_0, \dots, \mu_d \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that 
        \( p = \mu_0 \mathrm{col}(0) + \dots + \mu_d \mathrm{col}(d) \).

        \item There exist unique coefficients \( \lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_d \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that 
        \( p = \mu_0 \mathrm{row}(0) + \dots + \mu_d \mathrm{row}(d) \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( p = \sum c_{i,j}x_{i,j}\) be a Pascal form on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \). If we solve the equation
    \begin{align}\label{eq:234324324}
        \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j}x_{i,j} = \lambda_0 \mathrm{col}(0) + \dots + \lambda_d \mathrm{col}(d)
    \end{align}
    for \( \lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_d \), then due to Proposition \ref{prop:pascal-formulas} we have for all \( (i,j)\in V_d \) that
    \begin{align*}
        c_{i,j} &= \lambda_0 (-1)^{0+j} \binom{i}{0-j} + \lambda_1 (-1)^{1+j} \binom{i}{1-j} + \dots + \lambda_d (-1)^{d+j} \binom{i}{d-j} \\
        &= \lambda_j (-1)^{2j} \binom{i}{0} + \lambda_{j+1} (-1)^{2j+1} \binom{i}{1} + \dots + \lambda_{i+j} (-1)^{2j+i} \binom{i}{i}.
    \end{align*}

    We see \(c_{0, \cdot} = (\lambda_0, \cdots, \lambda_d) \). Thus, we set \( \boldsymbol \mu \coloneqq c_{0, \cdot} \). We see that \( \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} c_{i,j}x_{i,j} = \mu_0 \mathrm{col}(0) + \dots + \mu_d \mathrm{col}(d) \) by Proposition \ref{prop:supsup-pascal}. Moreover, the same proposition shows that the coefficients \( \lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_d \) in Equation \ref{eq:234324324} are uniquely determined. 
    
    For the second statement we use the same argument.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pascal-basis-2323}
    The sets \( \left\{ \mathrm{col}(k) \right\}_{k=0}^d \) and \( \left\{ \mathrm{row}(k) \right\}_{k=0}^d \) are a basis for all Pascal forms on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \). 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    This follows from the previous proposition.
\end{proof}

Let us come back to Theorem \ref{thm:pascal-outcome}. We now prove that roots of all Pascal equations on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) are outcomes.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:pascal-outcome-converse}
    Let \( d \in \mathbb{N} \) and \( \mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be a chip configuration. If for all Pascal equations \( p \) on \( \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \), we have \( p(\mathbf w) = 0 \), then \( \mathbf{w} \) is an outcome.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( \mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be a chip configuration.
    By assumption, we have 
    \begin{align}\label{eq:324324234324324}
        \mathrm{col}(\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w))(\mathbf w) = 0.
    \end{align}
    Note that by Proposition \ref{prop:pascal-formulas} for \( \mathrm{col}(\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w)) = \sum c_{i,j} x_{i,j}\), we have \( c_{i,\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) - i} = (-1)^{i} \) for all \( i =0, \dots, \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \). Moreover, by Proposition \ref{prop:pascal-formulas} we have 
    \begin{align}\label{eq:34kl}
        c_{i,j} = 0 \quad \text{for all \( i+j < \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \)}.
    \end{align}
      Together with Equation \ref{eq:324324234324324} and \ref{eq:34kl}, we obtain 
    \begin{align}\label{eq:2j2j1kjkj}
        \sum_{i=0}^{\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w)}(-1)^i w_{i, \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) - i} = 0.
    \end{align}
    Furthermore, we know that there exists a unique minimal set of splitting or unsplitting moves at vertices \( (i,j) \) of degree \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) - 1 \) such that, when applied to \( \mathbf w \), we obtain a chip configuration \( \mathbf w' \) with \( w'_{i,j} = 0 \) for all \( i =0, ... , \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \). We call applying these set of moves to \( \mathbf w \) \emph{retraction}.

    Thus, \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w') < \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w)  \).
    By Proposition \ref{prop:pascal-invariance}, \( \mathbf w' \) is also a root of all Pascal equations. We retract \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \)-many times until we obtain a chip configuration of degree zero, which is the initial configuration due to Equation \ref{eq:2j2j1kjkj}. Thus, \( \mathbf w \) is an outcome.
\end{proof}

We have successfully proved Theorem \ref{thm:pascal-outcome}. Characterizing outcomes as roots of Pascal equations is a powerful tool to determine if a chip configuration is an outcome.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Validating outcomes}\label{alg:pascal-equation-outcome}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require chipsplitting configuration \( \mathbf w \in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \)

        \EndIf

    \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}  
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of correctness of Algorithm \ref{alg:pascal-equation-outcome}]
    This follows from Theorem \ref{thm:pascal-outcome}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Returning to Example \ref{ex:dknfkdjsfnsdj}, we see that the chip configuration is a root of all Pascal equations \( \mathrm{col}(0), \dots, \mathrm{col}(6) \) using Algorithm \ref{alg:pascal-equation-outcome}. Thus, the chip configuration is an outcome.
\end{example}

\section{Valid Outcomes and Reduced Statistical Models}

In the previous sections, we established that outcomes are roots of Pascal forms. Now, we will demonstrate that a subset of \emph{valid outcomes} are in one-to-one correspondence with reduced statistical models. Thus, we can characterize reduced models algebraically through Pascal equations.

The function \( \mathbf w(\cdot) \) maps reduced models \( \mathcal{M} = (w_k, i_k, j_k)^{n}_{k=0} \) to chip configurations \( \mathbf w(\mathcal{M}) = (w_{i,j})_{(i,j) \in V_\infty} \) by 
\begin{align*}
    w_{i,j} \coloneqq \begin{cases}
        -1 & \text{if } (i,j) = (0,0), \\
        w_k & \text{if } (i,j) = (i_k, j_k) \text{ for some } k, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Note that \( \mathbf w(\mathcal{M}) \) is a \emph{real} chipsplitting game; the rules are exactly the same as for integer chipsplitting games.

\begin{example}\label{ex:binomial-model-chip-three}
    The binomial model \( ((1,3,0), (3,2,1), (3,1,2), (1,0,3)) \) is mapped to
    \begin{verbatim}
        1
        ·   3  
        .   ·   3
       -1   .   .   1.
    \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:alpaca-andy}
    Does the following valid outcome from Example \ref{ex:dknfkdjsfnsdj} induce a reduced statistical model via \( \mathbf w^{-1} \)?
    \begin{verbatim}
        · 
        ·   0.5 
      0.5     ·   2.5 
        ·   2.5     ·     1 
      0.5     .     .   2.5     . 
        ·     .     4     .     .     1 
       -1     ·     .     .     .     1     . 
    \end{verbatim} 
    The outcome would correspond to a reduced model in \( \Delta_9 \) represented by
    \begin{gather*}
        \mathcal{M} = ((0.5, 2, 0), (0.5, 4, 0), (2.5, 1,3), (0.5, 1, 5), (4, 2,1), (2.5, 2, 4),\\ (2.5, 3,2), (1, 3,3), (1, 5,0), (1,5,1))
    \end{gather*}
    As it turns out, \( \mathcal{M} \) is indeed a reduced model by the next theorem.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outcome-reduced-model}
    The map \( \mathcal{M} \mapsto w(\mathcal{M}) \) is a bijection between reduced statistical models and valid real outcomes \( \mathbf w \in \mathbb{R}^{V_\infty} \) with \( w_{0,0} = -1 \).
\end{theorem}


We first make some preparations. Let \( \mathbb{R}[\theta]_{\leq d} \) denote the vector space of polynomials in the variable \( \theta \) of degree at most \( d \) with real coefficients. Similarly, we define \( \mathbb{Z}[\theta]_{\leq d} \) and \( \mathbb{Q}[\theta]_{\leq d} \). Next, we introduce the linear map \( \alpha_{d}^{\mathbb R} \) that maps real chip configurations to real polynomials:
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_d^{\mathbb R}: \mathbb{R}^{V_d} \to \mathbb{R}[\theta]_{\leq d}, 
    \mathbf{w} \mapsto \sum_{(i,j) \in V_d} w_{i,j} \theta^{i}(1-\theta)^j.
\end{align*}
We define the map \( \alpha_d^{\mathbb Z} \) and \( \alpha_d^{\mathbb Q} \) for integer and rational chip configurations analogously.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:kernel-noo}
    The following statements hold true for all \( d \in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ \infty \right\} \):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( \left\{ \mathbf w \in \mathbb R^{V_d} \mid \text{\( \mathbf{w} \) is an outcome} \right\} = \mathrm{kernel}(\alpha_d^{\mathbb R})\);
        \item \( \left\{ \mathbf w \in \mathbb Z^{V_d} \mid \text{\( \mathbf{w} \) is an outcome} \right\} = \mathrm{kernel}(\alpha_d^{\mathbb Z})\);
        \item \( \left\{ \mathbf w \in \mathbb Q^{V_d} \mid \text{\( \mathbf{w} \) is an outcome} \right\} = \mathrm{kernel}(\alpha_d^{\mathbb Q})\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the first statement; the other two are proven analogously. Note that it suffices to show the statement for \( d < \infty \) since \( \alpha_\infty^\mathbb{R} \) is the direct limit of \( \alpha^{\mathbb R}_0, \alpha^{\mathbb R}_1, \alpha^{\mathbb R}_2, \dots \).

    Let \( d < \infty \). By Corollary \ref{cor:pascal-basis-2323}, the codimension of the outcome space is \( d+1 \), as it is defined by the roots of the Pascal forms \( \mathrm{col}(0), \dots, \mathrm{col}(d) \). 

    Let \( f(\theta) = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 \theta + \dots + \lambda_d \theta^d  \) be a real polynomial of degree \( \leq d \). Define a chipsplitting configuration \( \mathbf{w} \) by \(  w_{i,j} \coloneqq \begin{cases}
        \lambda_i & \text{if } j=0, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \).
    Then, \( \alpha^\mathbb{R}_d(\mathbf w) = f \) holds, which shows that the map \( \alpha^{\mathbb R}_d \) is surjective. Hence, the kernel of \( \alpha^{\mathbb R}_d \) has codimension \( d+1 \); it has equal codimension as the space of outcomes. 

    Finally, we show that the space of outcomes is contained in \( \mathrm{kernel}(\alpha^{\mathbb R}_d) \). Since their codimensions coincide, the two spaces coincide. Let \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{V_d} \) be an outcome. The value of \( \alpha^{\mathbb R}_d(\mathbf w) \) remains the same if we apply splitting or unsplitting moves at arbitrary vertices \( (i,j) \in V_{d-1} \) because we have \( -\theta^i(1-\theta)^j + \theta^{i+1}(1-\theta)^j + \theta^i(1-\theta)^{j+1} = \theta^i(1-\theta)^j (-1 + \theta + (1 - \theta)) = 0 \).
    The remaining claim follows from \( \alpha_d^{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbf 0) = 0 \).
\end{proof}

We are ready to show Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model}]
    Let \( \mathcal{M} = (w_k,i_k,j_k)_{k=0}^n \) be a reduced model. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item First, we prove that \( \mathbf w \coloneqq w(\mathcal{M}) \) is an outcome; a-priori, we only know that it is a chip configuration. By definition of \( w(\mathcal{M}) \), we have \( w_{0,0} = -1 \). Since \( \mathcal{M} \) is a model, we know that \( \sum_{k=0}^n w_k \theta^{i_k} (1-\theta)^{j_k} = 1 \). Thus, \( \alpha_d^{\mathbb R}(\mathbf w) = \sum_{k=0}^n w_k \theta^{i_k} (1-\theta)^{j_k} -1 = 0 \). Thus, \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathrm{kernel}(\alpha_d^{\mathbb R}) \) holds. By Lemma \ref{lem:kernel-noo}, the chip configuration \( \mathbf w \) is an outcome.
        
        \item \textbf{Injectivity:} Let \( \mathcal{M} = (w_k,i_k,j_k)^n_{k=0} \) and \( \mathcal{M}' = (w'_k,i'_k,j'_k)^n_{k=0} \) be two distinct models. Then, we have \( w(\mathcal{M}) \neq w(\mathcal{M}') \).
        
        \item \textbf{Surjectivity:} Let \( \mathbf w \in \mathbb{R}^{V_\infty} \) be a valid real outcome with \( w_{0,0} = -1 \). We define \( w_k \coloneqq w_{i_k,j_k}  \) for all \( k = 0, \dots, n \).
        Then, \( \mathcal{M}= (w_k,i_k,j_k)^n_{k=0} \) is a reduced model by Lemma \ref{lem:kernel-noo}. We see that \( w(\mathcal{M}) = \mathbf w \). Hence, \( \mathcal{M} \mapsto w(\mathcal{M}) \) is surjective.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:outcome-properties-bllaio}
    The following statements hold for all reduced models \( \mathcal{M} \):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( \mathrm{supp}^+(w(\mathcal{M})) = \mathrm{supp}^+(\mathcal{M})\).
        \item The map \( \mathcal{M} \mapsto w(\mathcal{M}) \) is degree-preserving.
        \item The outcome \( w(\mathcal{M}) \) is rational if and only if all the coefficients of \( \mathcal{M} \) are rational.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    All three statements follow directly from the definitions.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:outcome-rational-fluf}
    Let \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{Q}^{V_\infty} \) be a valid rational outcome. Then, there exist positive \( \lambda \in \mathbb{Q} \) and integral valid outcome \( \mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^{V_\infty} \) such that \( \mathbf{w} = \lambda \mathbf{z} \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( \mathbf{w} \) be a valid rational outcome; its support is finite. Thus, there exists \( \mu \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( \mu \mathbf w \in \mathbb{Z}^{V_\infty} \). Define \( \lambda \coloneqq \frac{1}{\mu} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \coloneqq \mu \mathbf{w} \). Clearly, \( \alpha^{\mathbb{Z}}_{\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf v)}(\mathbf v) = \mu \alpha^{\mathbb{Q}}_{\mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w)}(\mathbf w) \equiv 0 \). By Lemma \ref{lem:kernel-noo}, \( \mathbf v \) is an outcome. It is valid because \( \mu \mathbf w \) is valid.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:outcome-zero}
    Let \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{V_\infty} \) be a valid real outcome. If \( w_{0,0} = 0 \), then \( \mathbf{w} = \mathbf 0 \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    By Lemma \ref{lem:kernel-noo}, we have \( \sum w_{i,j}\theta^i (1-\theta)^j \equiv 0 \). By assumption, the negative support is empty. Hence, all the \( w_{i,j} \) are non-negative. We evaluate at \( \theta = \frac{1}{2} \) to conclude that the positive support of \( \mathbf w \) is empty. Hence, \( \mathbf w = 0 \).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Let us reconsider Example \ref{ex:binomial-model-chip-three}.
   We have seen that the valid outcome on the left-hand side induces a reduced model by Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model}. It has degree three and positive support size four. Can we find another outcome with the same degree but smaller positive support size? Indeed, we unsplit at vertex \( (1,1) \) to get the outcome on the right-hand side.
   \begin{verbatim}
1                        1
·   3                    ·   ·
.   ·   3                ·   3   ·    
-1   .   .   1          -1   ·   ·   1 
    \end{verbatim}
    Can we reduce the positive support size further? The answer is no, as we will find out.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let us fix the positive support size to be three. What is the largest degree of a valid outcome with positive support size three? We have already found
    \begin{verbatim}
        1  
        .   .     
        ·   3   .    
       -1   ·   .   1.   
    \end{verbatim} 
    However is there an even larger one? The answer is no.
 \end{example}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outcome-degree-support-size}
    Let \( \mathbf w \in \mathbb{Z}^{V_d} \) be a valid outcome with \( |\mathrm{supp}^+(\mathbf w)| \leq 5 \). Then, we have \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \leq 2 \cdot |\mathrm{supp}^+(\mathbf w)| - 3 \).
\end{theorem}

Bik and Orlando established this theorem in \cite{bik2022classifying}. Whether the upper bound extends to cases with larger positive support sizes, \( |\mathrm{supp}^+(\mathbf w)| > 5 \) remains open. This theorem is of particular interest because it is equivalent to Theorem \ref{thm:degree-fundamental-models}.

\begin{center}
    Degree of outcomes \( \mathbf{w} \) \( \longleftrightarrow \) Degree of statistical models \( \mathcal{M} \) \\
    \( \mathrm{supp}^+(\mathbf w) \) \( \longleftrightarrow \) Dimension of \( \mathcal{M} \)
\end{center}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:equivalence-degree-support-size}
    Theorem \ref{thm:degree-fundamental-models} and Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size} are equivalent. In other words, proving that the degree of outcomes is bounded by their positive support size is equivalent to establishing that the degree of statistical models is bounded by their dimension.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Assume Theorem \ref{thm:degree-fundamental-models} holds. We want to show Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size}. Let \( \mathbf{w} \) be a valid integral outcome of positive support size \( n \leq 5 \). Normalize \( \mathbf{w} \) such that \( w_{0,0} = -1 \). The degree and positive support size do not change. By Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model}, the outcome \( \mathbf{w} \) induces a reduced statistical model \( \mathcal{M} \) in \( \Delta_{n-1} \). Then, \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathcal{M}) \leq 2(n-1) -1 = 2n - 3\). Thus, applying Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model} let us go back to the outcome \( \mathbf w \), and Proposition \ref{prop:outcome-properties-bllaio} establishes \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) \leq 2n - 3 \).

    For the converse direction, assume Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size} holds. Let \( n \leq 5 \). We want to show Theorem \ref{thm:degree-fundamental-models}. Let \( \mathcal{M} = (w_k, i_k, j_k)_{k=0}^{n-1} \subset \Delta_{n-1} \) be a model with rational MLE. By Theorem \ref{thm:degree-fundamental-models-reduced}, we assume that \( \mathcal{M} \) is fundamental. We use Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-reduced-model} to map \( \mathcal{M} \) to a valid real outcome \( \mathbf{w} = (w_{i,j}) \) with \( w_{0,0} = -1 \). Note that \( \mathbf{w}  \) is \emph{rational} because by Definition \ref{def:fundamental-model} the weights \( (w_k)_{k=0}^{n-1} \) of the fundamental model \( \mathcal{M} \) are uniquely determined by the equation \( p_0(\theta) + p_1(\theta) + \dots + p_{n-1}(\theta) - 1 \equiv 0 \) and for some \( \theta \in [0,1] \) this equation becomes rational. Next, we use Proposition \ref{prop:outcome-rational-fluf} to find some integral valid outcome \( \mathbf{z} \) such that \( \mathbf w = \mu \mathbf{z} \) for some \( \mu \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \). Again, scaling does not affect the degree or positive support size. By Proposition \ref{prop:outcome-properties-bllaio}, the integral valid outcome  \( \mathbf{z} \) has positive support size \( n  \). By Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size}, we have \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf z) \leq 2n - 3 \). Thus, \( \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf w) = \mathrm{deg}(\mu \mathbf z) = \mathrm{deg}(\mathbf z) \leq 2n - 3 \) holds. Hence, the degree of \( \mathcal{M} \) is smaller or equal to \( 2(n-1) - 1 \) by Proposition \ref{prop:outcome-properties-bllaio}.
\end{proof}

Recall that our north star is to prove that only finitely many fundamental models exist in \( \Delta_n \) for \( n \leq 4 \). To achieve this, we originally aimed to prove Theorem \ref{thm:finiteness-fundamental-models} from Chapter 2. However, as established in Chapter 3, we may prove Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size} instead. We focus on Theorem \ref{thm:outcome-degree-support-size} because it allows us to address this problem combinatorically.
