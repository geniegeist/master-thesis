This paper continues the research of Arthur Bik and Orlando Marigliano on the classification of one-dimensional discrete statistical models with rational maximum likelihood estimators using fundamental models. We determine the number of fundamental models in the simplex \( \Delta_6 \) with a maximum degree of eleven, a result that was previously unknown. Moreover, we reduce the number of cases to consider for proving the finite number of fundamental models in the simplex \( \Delta_5 \) with a maximum degree of eleven from 300,000 to 12,000, making a proof far more feasible in the future. The algorithm underpinning these key results is embedded in the framework of solving non-trivial hyperfield linear systems, which we have developed specifically for this thesis. All the code is publicly available on GitHub.
