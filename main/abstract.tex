This thesis continues the work of Bik and Marigliano on the classification of one-dimensional discrete statistical models with rational maximum likelihood estimators using fundamental models. We compute the number of fundamental models in the simplex \( \Delta_6 \) with a maximum degree of eleven, a result that was previously unknown. Moreover, we reduce the number of cases to consider for proving the finite number of fundamental models with a maximum degree of eleven in the simplex \( \Delta_5 \) from 300,000 to 12,000, enabling a feasible proof in the future. We embed the algorithm underpinning these key results in the framework of solving non-trivial hyperfield linear systems, which we develop specifically for this thesis. The code is publicly available on GitHub.
