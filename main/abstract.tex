This paper continues the research of Arthur Bik and Orlando Marigliano on the classification of one-dimensional discrete statistical models with rational maximum likelihood estimators using fundamental models. We present a missing proof of an algorithm from their work. Furthermore, we make significant progress in proving the finite number of fundamental models in the probability simplex \( \Delta_5 \). We also determine the number of fundamental models in the simplex \( \Delta_6 \) with a maximum degree of 11.
